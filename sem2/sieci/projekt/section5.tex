\section{Conclusions}

All envisioned goals were successfully realized in this project. Nevertheless
NS-3 is still in development and implies a steep learning curve. The
Decorator API used for this project is not in the main tree of the
NS-3 project yet. Furthermore the Python bindings were not available
for the Decorator API and the biggest drawback is that the current
Python binding does not support callbacks yet. Therefore a switch
from Python to C++ actually was necessary to successfully complete
the project.
